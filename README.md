# Algo-DS
Algorithms and Data Structure written in Golang. As I learn more about these through my Open University and Frontend Masters courses, I wanted to have a go at implementing them in one of my favourite languages.

You can use these freely as you wish in your Golang applications.

## Data Structures
The following data structures have been included.
|Name|Description|
|-----------|---|
|Linked List|A linked list is a continuous list of items. Unlike static arrays it can dynamically grow as needed.|
|Binary Tree|Binary tree data structure begins with a "root" node. Each node holds up to 2 children only.|
|Queue|Similar to linked-list, but offers methods favouring FIFO workloads instead.|
|Set|A simple wrapper over maps in Golang to store an unordered collection of unique values.|

## Algorithms
1. Breadth-First-Search - Implemented for tree data structure to find a particular item.
2. Depth-First-Search - Implemented for tree data structure to find a particular item.
3. Binary-Search - Implemented for ordered tree structures.
4. Tree-Comparison - A compare function to check if two trees are equal by structure AND value.
